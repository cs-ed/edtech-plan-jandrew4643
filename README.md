# Educational Technology Plan

Provide a brief description of the purpose of your educational technology Plan

## Context


### Course

**Progamming and Software Engineering:**

This course is the *concentrator* course in the **Sofware and System Development Pathway**.

Students learn modern programming basics using logic, pseudocode, flow charts, and 
storyboarding with programs such as Python. This course is designed to introduce students 
to math concepts in computer programming and data manipulation fundamentals. There is an 
emphasis on top down programming technique; syntax; documentation methods; modular, event 
oriented and object-oriented programming. Opportunity will be gine to use 3D modeling in 
Blender and game design through Unity. Programming and Software Engineering experience is 
desired in most careers, even those outside of specific computer science fields, such as 
business, manufacturing, nursing, and law enforcement.

### Situation

Chico Senior High School is located in Chico, CA and is one of two comprehensive high
schools in the Chico Unified School District.  The overall student population is approximately 
2,000 students.  The **Industrial Technology Department** provides four pathways for students 
who are interested in Career and Technical Education fields.  The two pathways that fall under
*Computer Science* are **Information Support & Services**(ISS) and **Software and Systems 
Development**(SSD).  **ISS** consistes of the concentrator course **Computers, Components & the
Networking of Things** (grades 9-12) and the completer course **Cybersecurity & Networking** 
(grades 10-12).  Both are *DualEnrolled* eligible at Butte College.  **SSD** consistes of the 
concentrator course **Programming& Software Engineering** (grades 9-12) and the completer course 
**Robotics & Drone Design** (grades 10-12).  All course are taught on the Chico HS campus in 
room IT-5 with access to IT-6.  IT-5 has 42 computer stations, but typically has a maximum of 36
students in a class at a time.  The Instrutor has access to a projector, document camera and smart 
tv.  IT-6 is primarily used for CAM systems such as 3D printers, CNC router table, desktop waterjet 
and laser.  Additionally is hosts the robotics game field and acts as storage for equipment used 
in the ISS pathway.

## Plan

### Hardware Specifications

*Instrutor Station*
* Custom Built PC 
* BaseBoard: Z270 Tomahawk (MS-7A68)
* Processor: Intel Core i7-7700k CPU @ 4.20GHz, 420Mhz, 4core9s), 8 Logical Processor(s)
* 16.0 GB RAM
* 8 TB SSD / HHD over 4 drives
* Display Adaptor: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080
* Four 28" LED Displays

*It's a ridiculous machine for a teacher station, but I inhereted it from the previous teacher*

*Student Stations*
* Various Dell Optiplex 3040, 5050 and Precision 3430   
* Processors: Intel Core i5 or i7
* 16.0 GB RAM
* 500 GB HHD Storage
* 28" LED Display

All stations are 3 to 4 years old and are connected with Cat5e straight through connector to 
the CHS Campus Area Network

All students are also issued a personal Chromebook by CUSD.  They received a new one as Freshman and 
retain it for the 4 years of their high school tenure.

### Software Specifications

Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.

* Google Classroom as a learning managment system through Google Workplace
* Aeries Gradbook Student Information System
* codehs.com as student IDE for python, python (turtle) or java
* lucid.app for psuedocode, flowcharts, and storyboarding
* Runestone: Foundations of Python Programming textbook and workbook
* Computational Fairy Tales Blog used for reading for understanding

### Application

Google Classroom is used as the primary learning managment tool because Google Workplace is 
the deault Suite of online software that students used for email and data storage.  It works  


Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
