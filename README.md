# Educational Technology Plan

Provide a brief description of the purpose of your educational technology Plan

## Context


### Course

Progamming and Software Engineering:
This course is the *concentrator* course in the **Sofware and System Development Pathway**.

Students learn modern programming basics using logic, pseudocode, flow charts, and 
storyboarding with programs such as Python. This course is designed to introduce students 
to math concepts in computer programming and data manipulation fundamentals. There is an 
emphasis on top down programming technique; syntax; documentation methods; modular, event 
oriented and object-oriented programming. Opportunity will be gine to use 3D modeling in 
Blender and game design through Unity. Programming and Software Engineering experience is 
desired in most careers, even those outside of specific computer science fields, such as 
business, manufacturing, nursing, and law enforcement.

### Situation

Provide **relevant** details about your course and/or school that will influence the
decisions in the plan. What assets and constraints do you face? What is the
context of your class, considering demographic and technical resources?

## Plan

### Software Specifications

Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.

* Google Classroom as a learning managment system
* codehs.com as student IDE for python, python (turtle) or java
* Runestone: Foundations of Python Programming textbook and workbook
* Computational Fairy Tales Blog used for reading for understanding

### Hardware Specifications

Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary.

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
