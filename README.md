# Educational Technology Plan


## Context


### Course

**Progamming and Software Engineering:**

This course is the *concentrator* course in the **Sofware and System Development Pathway**.

Students learn modern programming basics using logic, pseudocode, flow charts, and 
storyboarding with programs such as Python. This course is designed to introduce students 
to math concepts in computer programming and data manipulation fundamentals. There is an 
emphasis on top down programming technique; syntax; documentation methods; modular, event 
oriented and object-oriented programming. Opportunity will be gine to use 3D modeling in 
Blender and game design through Unity. Programming and Software Engineering experience is 
desired in most careers, even those outside of specific computer science fields, such as 
business, manufacturing, nursing, and law enforcement.

### Situation

Chico Senior High School is located in Chico, CA and is one of two comprehensive high
schools in the Chico Unified School District.  The overall student population is approximately 
2,000 students.  The **Industrial Technology Department** provides four pathways for students 
who are interested in Career and Technical Education fields.  The two pathways that fall under
*Computer Science* are **Information Support & Services** (ISS) and **Software and Systems 
Development** (SSD).  **ISS** consistes of the concentrator course **Computers, Components & the
Networking of Things** (grades 9-12) and the completer course **Cybersecurity & Networking** 
(grades 10-12).  Both are *Dual Enrolled* eligible at Butte College.  **SSD** consistes of the 
concentrator course **Programming& Software Engineering** (grades 9-12) and the completer course 
**Robotics & Drone Design** (grades 10-12).  All course are taught on the Chico HS campus in 
room IT-5 with access to IT-6.  IT-5 has 46 computer stations, but typically has a maximum of 36
students in a class at a time.  The Instrutor has access to a projector, document camera and smart 
tv.  IT-6 is primarily used for CAM systems such as 3D printers, CNC router table, desktop waterjet 
and laser.  Additionally is hosts the robotics game field and acts as storage for equipment used 
in the ISS pathway.

### Application

1. Google Classroom: is used as the primary learning managment tool because Google Workplace is the default Suite of online software that students used for email and data storage. It works well on classroom computers and Chromebooks. Students have access to all their work on and off school site. It is also integrated into Aeries Gradebook to make pushing grades from one to the other easier.
2. www.codehs.com is a free interactive online learning platrom that offers IDE's in many computer languages including, but not limited to, python, python (turtle) and Java. Students share their work via a link given to the instrutor.
3. www.lucid.app has a free education center that allows students to log in using their existing school
username and password. This space allows students to create flowchart diagrams easily as well as other  planning, like pseudocode. Students share their work via a link given to the instrutor.
4. www.runestone.academy is an open source, online repository of programming language textbooks with built in IDE and code lens. This course uses *Foundations of Python Programming*
5. www.computationaltales.blogspot.com is an free resourse that breaks down computer science concepts by  adapting the concepts into a fairytale or mythical setting.  It helps students understand understand the various concepts from a different point of view.
6. *Unity* is a platform that students can use for their 2nd semester project that is abailable on the stations in IT-5, but not on their chromebooks.

### Example of Unit Lesson Progression: Boolean Values and Conditional Statements

1. Lesson Preview: Assign readings from Computational Fairy Tales - [The Town of Bool: Part 1 of Ann's encounter with the Booleans](http://computationaltales.blogspot.com/2011/05/town-of-bool.html), [The Gates of XOR: Part 2 of Ann's encounter with the Booleans](http://computationaltales.blogspot.com/2011/05/gates-of-xor.html), and [The Valley of NAND and NOR: Part 3 of Ann's encounter with the Booleans](http://computationaltales.blogspot.com/2011/05/valley-of-nand-and-nor-part-3-of-anns.html).  Short stories where all three can generally be read in 10 to 15 minutes. Check for understanding by having groups of four record and share the key points and have each group share one key point to the class.
2. Use SmartTV or video projector to share video on Python Booleans.  Video [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=9OK32jb_TdI).  When video is over do manual Boolean logic problems with the class having them raise their hands to predict if the value will be True or False. (Hint: write down the problems you plan to use ahead of time so you are not standing in front of the room trying to think up math problems on the fly).
3. Distribute this [worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pPeAqWLMX92aKzeEW58R9zcBhwyN4mAZzzU6sB-0GEU/edit?usp=sharing) that contain True and False equations via Google Classroom.  Students must show work of evaluating the equation and identify its Boolean value.  Have students work on it for 15 to 20 minutes individually.  5 minutes with their Paired Programming Partner.  1 minute with their table of 4.  Worksheet submitted when done. This ensures that students have time to figure it out on their own but have a safety net to catch any misunderstandings within the group.
4. Share [Unit 3_Day 1 Notes Prompt](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s6x_m-bHiOyhdxXTurfJnXDozjmrY-VMfcW61DITPj4/edit?usp=sharing) with class.  They will use this to fill in where appropriate and check with pair partner before the end of class.  Demo on screen using CodeHS.com how Python Syntax for Boolean values are used and identified. Notes are used for reference when not able to seek help from peers or instructor.
5. Assign reading and exercises from Runestone: Foundations of Python Programming [8.2 through 8.5](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/fopp/Conditionals/BooleanValuesandBooleanExpressions.html).  Play videos in class if desired to reinforce concepts.  This assignment can be done during class time or assigned to do out of the classroom. Readings and exercises give the students small bits of content at a time before everything is put together in a full lab.
6. Demo [lucid.app] to students for flowcharting using actual programming logic with conditional statements to be used as a template.  Have students submit shared link to Google Classroom to ensure they know how to use the feature for Python Labs. Prior to this lab, only pseudocode has been required. This gives them additional tools to be able to chart how they envision their program to flow and refer back to if changes need to be made.
7. Assign Python [Lab 5_Conditional Statements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16C2pp-F14S1HNilwmoe0AMLblySx7ffpoPnhvm3dF9s/edit?usp=sharing) to students through Google Classroom.  Assignment must include pseudocode, flowchart, snip of output terminal from codehs.com and link to actual code. Give students at least 30 minutes in class for two class periods to work on their code.  Use Paired Partners and Table Group to seek help for troubleshooting before calling on the instructor or TA for assistance. Exemplar of documentation [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZdhulWJeuDvcQPM4S0xUO7KwZYpVcqUn/view?usp=sharing).
8. Peer review and reflection. Students are randomly assigned another students program to review and provide feedback on.  Once the review is received, the student who wrote the program will write a reflection explaining how they thought they did with their program and what changes they would immplement if they had to do it again with their current knowledge and skill.

### Impacts
Besides learning sytax and symantics of Python programming, much of this course has focus on troubleshooting, problemsolving, and teamwork (Soft Skills).  The use of Paired Partners and slightly larger groups of 4 to 5 students helps students realize they are not alone in their learning process.  Being able to call on others besides the instructor for assistance helps them develope a sense of community within the classroom.  Paired Parntners and groups should be rotated occasionally so that students can learn that everyone in class is a resource.

After the COVID lockdown of 2020, it became imperative that whatever tools were being used to deliver content, be accessible from a online environment to be able to continue instruction by remote means.

The current configuration of stations in IT-5 conssists of 30 stations on tables with backed chairs at the front of the room.  The Back two rows are raised counters with 16 computers stations with stools for seats.  On order are rolling technology work stations that can fit 4 to 6 students per station.  While most will be taller to allow students to work while standing, stools will be provided.  Two shorter rolling technology work stations will be in the room that will facilitate any students needing wheel chair or backed chair accomodations. 

Once the rolling work stations are in place. Two additional Smart TV's have been obtained to mount on the wall space for student collaboration and whiteboard space.  

Additional enrichment activities beyond the class include optional participation in SkillsUSA, , MESA-*Math, Engineering, Science Achievement*, SWE-*Society of Women Engineers*, CHS Computer Science Club, and Panther Robotics.
